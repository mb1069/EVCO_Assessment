Lit review:
Snake AI works, but is not as successful as advertised (see approach1.py)



To try:
3 tiered fitness function:
- First get a snake that explores every tile
- Then maximise score
- Then minimise number of steps taken for optimal solution

Plan:
First define fitness function / set of operators for GP/grammatical evo

Then contrast GP, GE and neural networks
