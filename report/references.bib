                  a rectangular board attempts to avoid the walls and its own
                  body while eating pieces of food. The problem is particularly
                  interesting because as the snake eats the food, its body
                  grows, causing the space through which the snake can navigate
                  to become more confined. Furthermore, with each piece of food
                  eaten, a new piece of food is generated in a random location
                  in the playing field, adding an element of uncertainty to the

               cell phone is not only a successful communications technology;
               it is also key to the future of media. Global Mobile Media
               offers an overview of the complex topic of mobile media, looking
               at the emerging industry structures, new media economies, mobile
               media cultures and network politics of cell phones as they move
               centre-stage in media industries. The development, adoption and
               significance of cell phones for society and culture have been
               registered in a growing body of work. Where existing books have
               focused on communication, and on the social and cultural aspects
               of mobile media, Global Mobile Media looks at the media
               dimensions. Goggin provides a pioneering yet measured evaluation
               of how cell phone corporations, media interests, users and
               policy makers are together shaping a new media dispensation.

               defined to decide player's best move. For choosing the best from
               the solutions generated, by combination of mutating zero as 1,
               certain axioms are defined. The beauty of this method lies in
               the fact that if the player decides a move with this method, he
               never loses the match whenever the player begins the game. We
               suspect that functions can be defined on the similar grounds for
               other existing board games and some of this work is in progress

                  body while eating pieces of food. The problem is particularly
                  interesting because as the snake eats the food, its body
                  grows, causing the space through which the snake can navigate
                  to become more confined. Furthermore, with each piece of food
                  eaten, a new piece of food is generated in a random location
                  in the playing field, adding an element of uncertainty to the
                  program. This paper will focus on the development and
                  analysis of a successful function set that will allow the
                  evolution of a genetic program that causes the snake to eat
                  the maximum possible pieces of food.",

               using genetic programming to enhance its performance by evolving
               a new default policy to replace the random agent used in the
               simulations. The new agent with the evolved default policy was
               able to achieve an 18\% increase on its average score over the
               agent with random default policy.",

                  optimize a problem featuring task prioritization in a
                  dynamic, randomly updated environment. The specific problem
                  approached is the ``snake game'' in which a snake confined to
                  a rectangular board attempts to avoid the walls and its own
                  body while eating pieces of food. The problem is particularly
                  interesting because as the snake eats the food, its body
                  grows, causing the space through which the snake can navigate
                  to become more confined. Furthermore, with each piece of food
                  eaten, a new piece of food is generated in a random location
                  in the playing field, adding an element of uncertainty to the
                  program. This paper will focus on the development and
                  analysis of a successful function set that will allow the
                  evolution of a genetic program that causes the snake to eat
                  the maximum possible pieces of food.",
