               for playing tic-tac-toe game, in which 9 objective functions are
               defined to decide player's best move. For choosing the best from
               the solutions generated, by combination of mutating zero as 1,
               certain axioms are defined. The beauty of this method lies in
               the fact that if the player decides a move with this method, he
               never loses the match whenever the player begins the game. We
               suspect that functions can be defined on the similar grounds for
               other existing board games and some of this work is in progress
